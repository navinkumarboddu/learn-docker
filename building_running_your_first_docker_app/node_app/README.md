# Build Docker Image
1. Run from node_app directory :
   ```bash
   docker build -t <_name_> .
   ```
    OR
   Use if file is not Dockerfile
    ```bash
    docker build -t <_name_> -f <_file name other than Dockerfile_> .
   ```

# Check image
Run the below command to find the image you built in the list. 
```bash
docker images
```

# Docker Login Without 2FA:

To perform a Docker login without 2FA, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <password>
```

Replace **<_username_>** with your Docker Hub username and **<_password_>** with your Docker Hub password. Note that using the password directly might not be secure, and it's recommended to use an access token or use the docker login command interactively, allowing you to enter your credentials securely.

# Docker Login With 2FA:

When using 2FA, you need to use a personal access token instead of your password. Follow these steps:

a. Generate a personal access token on the Docker Hub website.

b. Use the access token for the Docker login:

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <access-token>
```

Replace **<_username_>** with your Docker Hub username and **<_access-token_>**

# Tag the Docker Image:
Before pushing the image, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and the desired repository name. Use the following command:

```bash
docker tag <image-id> <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```

Replace **<_image-id_>** with the ID of the Docker image you want to push, 
**<_username_>** with your Docker Hub username, **<_repository_>** with the name of your Docker Hub repository, and **<_tag_>** with a version or tag for your image.


# Push the Docker Image:
Now, push the tagged image to Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
    docker push <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```

Replace **<_username_>**, **<_repository_>**, and **<_tag_>** with the same values used in the previous step.

After executing these commands, your Docker image should be pushed to Docker Hub. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to push images to the specified repository. If you encounter any issues, ensure that you are properly authenticated and that the image is correctly tagged.

# Running the Docker Container:
To run a Docker container, you can use the **docker run** command. Here's a basic example:

```bash
docker run <image>
```

Replace **<_image_>** with the name or ID of the Docker image you want to run. Additionally, you might want to add some options or arguments based on your requirements.

For example, if you want to run the container in the background (detached mode), you can use the -d flag:

```bash
docker run -d <image>
```

If the container exposes ports and you want to map them to your local 
machine, you can use the **`-p`** option:

```bash
docker run -p <local-port>:<container-port> <image>
```

Replace **<_local-port_>** with the port on your machine and <container-port> with the port exposed by the container.

Here's a more complete example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_container my_image
```

This command runs a container named **"my_container"** in detached mode, maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 on the container, using the Docker image named **"my_image."**

### View Docker Logs and Volume:
To view logs and use volumes in Docker, you can leverage the docker logs command for logs and the -v option to handle volumes. Here are explanations for both:
##### 1. Docker Logs:

To view the logs of a running Docker container, you can use the docker logs command. Here's an example:

```bash
docker logs <container-name-or-id>
```

Replace **<_container-name-or-id_>** with the actual name or ID of your running container. This command will display the logs generated by the container.

####2. Docker Volumes:

Docker volumes allow you to persist data outside of the container, making it accessible and shareable between containers. You can use the -v option with docker run to mount volumes.

Here's a basic example:

```bash
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path <image>
```

   **/host/path:** This is the path on your host machine.
   **/container/path:** This is the path where the data will be available inside the container.
   **<image>:** Replace this with the name or ID of your Docker image.

For instance, if you are using a MySQL container and want to persist the database data, you might use:

```bash
docker run -v /path/on/host:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password> -d mysql:latest
```

This command creates a volume for MySQL data on the host machine at /path/on/host and mounts it to /var/lib/mysql inside the container.

Remember to adjust paths, names, and other parameters based on your specific use case and requirements.
